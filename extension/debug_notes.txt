// Explanation:
// The error `SyntaxError: export declarations may only appear at top level...`
// usually occurs because Vite bundles `rrweb` which might be using ESM exports,
// and if it's not fully tree-shaken or if the output format isn't IIFE,
// Firefox chokes on `export` statements in content scripts.
//
// We will modify vite.config.ts to ensure content scripts are bundled as IIFE?
// The @crxjs/vite-plugin should handle this...
//
// Let's first look at `content.ts` again. It imports `record` from `rrweb`.
// If I change this to a dynamic import or verify vite config...
//
// A common fix for this specific Firefox error with Vite extensions is to ensure
// the content script doesn't accidentally export anything (it doesn't appear to).
//
// Wait, `record` import might be bringing in code that has exports if not bundled correctly.
// Let's try explicitly importing from the specific path or checking if we can use a basic script.
